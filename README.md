## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code was written with Python 3. There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the most recent  3 years of Stack Overflow data from 2018 to 2020 to better understand:

1. How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field?
4. What was the state of bootcamps for assisting individuals with breaking into developer roles?
5. How were bootcamps assisting with increasing diversity in tech careers?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
