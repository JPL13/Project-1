## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code was written with Python 3. There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the most recent  3 years of Stack Overflow data from 2018 to 2020 to better understand
Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Software Developers:

1. What are the trends in the job market? Are data-related jobs rapidly increasing? 
2. Is there any difference between the four professions in terms of salary?
3. What about job satisfaction? How many respondents want to leave their current job? Which factors are most important when choosing a new job? 
4. What languages and databases are used most for each role?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@xiaoruyue1986/how-do-you-choose-software-engineer-data-scientist-data-engineer-or-data-analyst-1cc5ec47dff2?sk=23fb99241839aa8a31f6fcfe1f3b169c).
